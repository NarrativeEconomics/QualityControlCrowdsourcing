We will have two types of users, Standard(300k/1400k,idle timeout 01:00:00) and Premium (1000k/7000k,idle timeout 1d 00:00:00) we will provide a static (no radius) password for the Standard users and another password for the Premium users Users will get ip addresses from 192.168.88.2 to [url removed, login to view] but if the pool is full the RB will have to provide new pool addresses ie 192.168.89.2 to [url removed, login to view], after to 192.168.90.2-254 and at the end 192.168.91.2-254 but normally 100-300 users will have been connected But if the APs have a static address, ie [url removed, login to view] how will a user with an ip from different range be connected? (ie has 192.168.90.3)? Do you have a solution for this? the hotspot login page will have to show up upon a user connects even if the webpage is secure([url removed, login to view] etc).
